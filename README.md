## Overview

This project is the developer's first attempt at making a video game and will be using the Godot engine. The basic concept is a maze-like game with enemies and other Roguelike elements, but this is subject to change. More details about the scope of the game and planned features can be found in the wiki.

The game is currently in the early stages of development. The project's name will be changed when the scope is better understood.


## Installation

To playtest the game on 64-bit Windows, visit the [Releases](https://github.com/KyleWJohnston/my-game/releases) page and download the most recent release. Open the folder and run (double-click) `Godot_vX.X.X-stable_win64.exe` to launch the game.

To playtest on a different operating system, try the most recent version of the game, or contribute to the project, you will need to download the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/download). Next, download the current game as a zip file from the main GitHub page to playtest or pull using Git to contribute to the project. Start Godot by double-clicking the Godot executable and import the game folder (the folder with `engine.cfg` in it) into Godot (drag-and-drop is supported). Finally, open the project in Godot and press play (or F5).


## Gameplay

On keyboard, use WASD and the arrow keys to move and space to pause.

On gamepad, use the d-pad and buttons to move and start to pause.
